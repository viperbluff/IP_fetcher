# IP_fetcher
Generating IP in bulk for list of domains/sub-domains passed to the bash script.

You can pas the list of domains/sub-domains generated from tools like assetfinder,findomain,sublist3r, subfinder etc and get a file containing unique IP's , this file can be further passed to port scanning tools.

I have used dig in the bash script so you can specify which DNS resolver to use as well by just passing the DNS resolver IP.

Below tools have been used:

1. anew
2. unfurl
